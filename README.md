## Objectives  
&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this project is to create a mock Administrative panel with the following pages:  
  - index.php: shows a list of customers from the aviano-db.  
  - customer.php?id=3: shows a single customer that corresponds to id.  
  - error.php: static error page if there is a database connection error.   

## Comments  
This helped me get a bit more practice with PHP and SQL. In-class tutorials as well as the Net Ninja PHP tutorials helped a lot.
